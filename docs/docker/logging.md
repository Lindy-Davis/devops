#Information About Docker Logging & Configuration
CWDS uses Docker containers to package and deploy components. Specifics about Docker are not covered here, but the specific configuration we use is (TODO).

##Docker Logging Options
Docker logging options are generally covered on the Docker web site at

> https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/

The logging options that we use are likely to change and evolve as we learn and grow, but we will start with Syslog, AWS CloudWatch, and Splunk.
